A JavaScript library for Tweening DOM Objects using CSS transitions

This Library is for people who like using the Greensock Animation Platform [(GSAP)](http://www.greensock.com/) but want GPU acceleration for their transitions.
It uses a similar API to TweenLite but does not come close to the amount of features.
